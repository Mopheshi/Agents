# Preprocessing Unstructured Data for LLM Applications

Enhancing a RAG system's performance through efficient preprocessing of diverse unstructured data is the focus of this course. You will learn techniques to represent and process text, images, and tables from various sources, extending your LLM RAG pipeline to handle Excel, Word, PowerPoint, PDF, and EPUB files. The course covers preprocessing data for LLM applications, including extracting and normalizing documents into a common JSON format enriched with metadata to improve search results. Additionally, you will learn document image analysis techniques, such as layout detection and vision transformers, to extract and understand PDFs, images, and tables. By the end of the course, you'll be equipped to build a RAG bot capable of ingesting different documents and applying these skills to real-world scenarios, enhancing the versatility of your RAG application.
